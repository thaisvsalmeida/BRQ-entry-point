		<div id="l"><p>Bury all your secrets in my skin
			Come away with innocence,<br>
			And leave me with my sins<br>
			The air around me still feels like a cage<br>
			And love is just a camouflage<br>
			for what resembles rage again...<br></p>
			<p>So if you love me, let me go.
			And run away before I know.<br>
			My heart is just too dark to care.<br>
			I can't destroy what isn't there.<br>
			Deliver me into my fate -<br>
			If I'm alone I cannot hate<br>
			I don't deserve to have you...<br>
			My smile was taken long ago<br>
			If I can change I hope I never know<br></p>
			<p>I still press your letters to my lips
			And cherish them in parts,<br>
			Of me that savor every kiss<br>
			I couldn't face a life without your light<br>
			But all of that was ripped apart...<br>
			When you refused to fight<br></p>
			<p>So save your breath, I will not hear.
			I think I made it very clear.<br>
			You couldn't hate enough to love.<br>
			Is that supposed to be enough?<br>
			I only wish you weren't my friend.<br>
			Then I could hurt you in the end.<br>
			I never claimed to be a saint...<br>
			My own was banished long ago<br>
			It took the death of hope to let you go<br></p>
			<p>So break yourself against my stones
			And spit your pity in my soul<br>
			You never needed any help<br>
			You sold me out to save yourself<br>
			And I won't listen to your shame<br>
			You ran away - you're all the same<br>
			Angels lie to keep control...<br>
			My love was punished long ago<br>
			If you still care, don't ever let me know<br>
			If you still care, don't ever let me know...</p></div>
