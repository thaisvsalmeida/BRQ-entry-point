	<h1>Three Days Grace - Never Too Late</h1>
		<div id="l"><p>This world will never be<br>
						What I expected<br>
						And if I don't belong<br>
						Who would have guessed it<br>
						I will not leave alone<br>
						Everything that I own<br>
						To make you feel like it's not too late<br>
						It's never too late</p>
						<p>Even if I say<br>
						It'll be alright<br>
						Still I hear you say<br>
						You want to end your life<br>
						Now and again, we try<br>
						To just stay alive<br>
						Maybe we'll turn it all around<br>
						'Cause it's not too late<br>
						It's never too late</p>
						<p>No one will ever see<br>
						This side reflected<br>
						And if there's something wrong<br>
						Who would have guessed it<br>
						And I have left alone<br>
						Everything that I own<br>
						To make you feel like<br>
						It's not too late<br>
						It's never too late</p>
						<p>Even if I say<br>
						It'll be alright<br>
						Still I hear you say<br>
						You want to end your life<br>
						Now and again, we try<br>
						To just stay alive<br>
						Maybe we'll turn it all around<br>
						'Cause it's not too late<br>
						It's never too late</p>
						<p>The world we knew<br>
						Won't come back<br>
						The time we've lost<br>
						Can't get back<br>
						The life we had<br>
						Won't be ours again</p>
						<p>This world will never be<br>
						What I expected<br>
						And if I don't belong</p>
						<p>Even if I say<br>
						It'll be alright<br>
						Still I hear you say<br>
						You want to end your life<br>
						Now and again, we try<br>
						To just stay alive<br>
						Maybe we'll turn it all around<br>
						'Cause it's not too late<br>
						It's never too late<br>
						Maybe we'll turn it all around<br>
						'Cause it's not too late<br>
						It's never too late (it's never too late)<br>
						It's not too late<br>
						It's never too late</p></div>
